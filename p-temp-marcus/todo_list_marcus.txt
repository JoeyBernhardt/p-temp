# PRIMARY GOALS #

1. Email Ben Gilbert. *DONE*
2. Fix script w/ theoretical predictions for fig 1 and commit to Joey's repo. *DONE*
3. Write script similar to (2.), but for short term predictions. *DONE*
3. Optimize the data-grabbing component of the model fitting workflow. *DONE*
4. Fix the model fitting process itself. *DONE*
5. Fit models to the data. Efficiently. *DONE*

The validity of the results produced by (2.) and (3.) depend on (5.) being
complete, but the base code can still be written ahead of time.

# Nagging questions #

1. O'Connor et al. use "lsoda" for solving the differential equations. Is
there a better alternative?
