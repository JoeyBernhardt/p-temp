### TO DO LIST ###
Last updated Oct 05 2016 

# PRIMARY GOALS #

1. Email Ben Gilbert. *DONE*
2. Fix script w/ theoretical predictions for fig 1 and commit to Joey's repo.
3. Write script similar to (2.), but for short term predictions.
3. Optimize the data-grabbing component of the model fitting workflow.
4. Fix the model fitting process itself.
5. Fit models to the data. Efficiently.

The validity of the results produced by (2.) and (3.) depend on (5.) being
complete, but the base code can still be written ahead of time.

# Nagging questions #

1. O'Connor et al. use "lsoda" for solving the differential equations. Is
there a better alternative?
